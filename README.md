# Scroller-Rush
This the Epitech Scroller Rush.
It was done in two days using the CSFML library. All C functions and CSFML functions were authorized except some key ones.
Grade: 16,25.
I prioritized music and story over excessive effects which payed pretty well. I feel it has a very unique feel to it.
It will be up to you to judge for that :^)

To use, just make sure you have the SFML library installed as well as the C wrappers. And just use "make" to compile.

The music used was the Pony Island trailer music.
